# Food Classification

Please refer to https://cuberule.com for a brief introduction.

This project aims to clarify many edge cases that may come about as a result of food classification.

Example:
A hot dog is a taco.
However, what if the taco shell cracks in half, resulting in the taco's inner components being surrounded by disconnected structural starches? Is this now a sandwich?

By that logic, after you bite a burrito, does it become a quiche?

Or what if you make a burrito out of a tortilla with multiple holes in it? Do those change its classification from a calzone, to a quiche or sushi?

And seriously, what *exactly* is a structural starch?
